# Miden node proto

This crate contains protobuf bindings for the APIs exposed by the components of the Miden node and domain types.

> [!WARNING]
> This crate is intended for internal use only. For gRPC bindings please see the [miden-node-proto-build](../../proto/README.md) crate.\
> This crate does not support TLS and cannot be used as a client for the official RPC endpoints.

## Error handling

The node's gRPC endpoints return rich error information using gRPC status details. Each component exposes its own set of error codes which are included in the response details.

- Error types are defined in this crate's `src/errors/` directory:
  - `src/errors/mod.rs` - Common error traits and conversion utilities
  - `src/errors/store.rs` - Store component gRPC error enums
  - `src/errors/block_producer.rs` - Block producer component gRPC error enums
