# Miden network monitor

A monitor app for a Miden network's infrastructure.

## Installation

The binary can be installed using the project's Makefile:

```bash
make install-network-monitor
```

## Configuration

The monitor application supports configuration through both command-line arguments and environment variables. Command-line arguments take precedence over environment variables.

### Command-line Arguments

```bash
# View all available options
miden-network-monitor --help

# Common usage examples
miden-network-monitor start --port 8080 --rpc-url http://localhost:50051
miden-network-monitor start --remote-prover-urls http://prover1.com:50052,http://prover2.com:50053
miden-network-monitor start --faucet-url http://localhost:8080 --enable-otel
```

**Available Options:**
- `--rpc-url`: RPC service URL (default: `http://localhost:50051`)
- `--remote-prover-urls`: Comma-separated list of remote prover URLs. If omitted or empty, prover tasks are disabled.
- `--faucet-url`: Faucet service URL for testing. If omitted, faucet testing is disabled.
- `--disable-ntx-service`: Disable the network transaction service checks (enabled by default). The network transaction service consists of two components: counter increment (sending increment transactions) and counter tracking (monitoring counter value changes).
- `--remote-prover-test-interval`: Interval at which to test the remote provers services (default: `2m`)
- `--faucet-test-interval`: Interval at which to test the faucet services (default: `2m`)
- `--status-check-interval`: Interval at which to check the status of the services (default: `3s`)
- `--request-timeout`: Timeout for outgoing requests (default: `10s`)
- `--port, -p`: Web server port (default: `3000`)
- `--enable-otel`: Enable OpenTelemetry tracing
- `--wallet-filepath`: Path where the wallet account is located (default: `wallet_account.mac`)
- `--counter-filepath`: Path where the network account is located (default: `counter_program.mac`)
- `--counter-increment-interval`: Interval at which to send the increment counter transaction (default: `30s`)
- `--help, -h`: Show help information
- `--version, -V`: Show version information

### Environment Variables

If command-line arguments are not provided, the application falls back to environment variables:

- `MIDEN_MONITOR_RPC_URL`: RPC service URL
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_REMOTE_PROVER_URLS`: Comma-separated list of remote prover URLs. If unset or empty, prover tasks are disabled.
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_FAUCET_URL`: Faucet service URL for testing. If unset, faucet testing is disabled.
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_DISABLE_NTX_SERVICE`: Set to `true` to disable the network transaction service checks (enabled by default). This affects both counter increment and tracking components.
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_REMOTE_PROVER_TEST_INTERVAL`: Interval at which to test the remote provers services
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_FAUCET_TEST_INTERVAL`: Interval at which to test the faucet services
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_STATUS_CHECK_INTERVAL`: Interval at which to check the status of the services
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: Timeout for outgoing requests
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_PORT`: Web server port
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_ENABLE_OTEL`: Enable OpenTelemetry tracing
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_WALLET_FILEPATH`: Path where the wallet account is located
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_COUNTER_FILEPATH`: Path where the network account is located
- `MIDEN_MONITOR_COUNTER_INCREMENT_INTERVAL`: Interval at which to send the increment counter transaction

## Commands

The monitor application supports one main command:

### Start Monitor

Starts the network monitoring service with the web dashboard. RPC status is always enabled. Other tasks are optional and spawn only when configured:

- Prover checks/tests: enabled when `--remote-prover-urls` (or `MIDEN_MONITOR_REMOTE_PROVER_URLS`) is provided
- Faucet testing: enabled when `--faucet-url` (or `MIDEN_MONITOR_FAUCET_URL`) is provided
- Network transaction service: enabled when `--disable-ntx-service=false` or unset (or `MIDEN_MONITOR_DISABLE_NTX_SERVICE=false` or unset)

```bash
# Start with default configuration (RPC only)
miden-network-monitor start

# Start with custom configuration
miden-network-monitor start --port 8080 --rpc-url http://localhost:50051

# Enable network transaction service (both increment and tracking) with custom account file paths
miden-network-monitor start \
  --wallet-filepath my_wallet.mac \
  --counter-filepath my_network_account.mac \
  --rpc-url https://testnet.miden.io:443
```

**Optional Counter Account Management (only when counter is enabled):**
When `--disable-ntx-service=false` or unset, the monitor ensures required network transaction service account exists before starting the task:
1. If file is missing, creates new counter account:
   - Network account with the increment procedure
2. Saves network account to the specified file using the Miden `AccountFile` format
3. Deploys accounts to the network via RPC (if not already deployed)
4. The network account contract authorizes increments only from a whitelisted wallet account

## Usage

### Using Command-line Arguments

```bash
# Single remote prover
miden-network-monitor start --remote-prover-urls http://localhost:50052

# Multiple remote provers and custom configuration
miden-network-monitor start \
  --remote-prover-urls http://localhost:50052,http://localhost:50053,http://localhost:50054 \
  --faucet-url http://localhost:8080 \
  --disable-ntx-service=false \
  --remote-prover-test-interval 2m \
  --faucet-test-interval 2m \
  --status-check-interval 3s \
  --port 8080 \
  --wallet-filepath my_wallet.mac \
  --counter-filepath my_counter.mac \
  --enable-otel

# Get help
miden-network-monitor --help
```

### Using Environment Variables

```bash
# Single remote prover
MIDEN_MONITOR_REMOTE_PROVER_URLS="http://localhost:50052" miden-network-monitor start

# Multiple remote provers, faucet testing, and network transaction service
MIDEN_MONITOR_REMOTE_PROVER_URLS="http://localhost:50052,http://localhost:50053,http://localhost:50054" \
MIDEN_MONITOR_FAUCET_URL="http://localhost:8080" \
MIDEN_MONITOR_WALLET_FILEPATH="my_wallet.mac" \
MIDEN_MONITOR_COUNTER_FILEPATH="my_counter.mac" \
MIDEN_MONITOR_DISABLE_NTX_SERVICE=false \
miden-network-monitor start
```

Once running, the monitor will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).

  - Expected counter value based on successful increments sent
  - Pending increments: How many transactions are queued/unprocessed
  - Last updated timestamp

## User Interface

The web dashboard provides a clean, responsive interface with the following features:

- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically refreshes service status every 10 seconds
- **Unified Service Cards**: Each service is displayed in a dedicated card that auto-sizes to show all information
- **Combined Prover Information**: Remote prover cards integrate both connectivity status and proof generation test results
- **Faucet Testing Display**: Shows faucet test results with challenge difficulty and minting success metrics
- **Visual Health Indicators**: Color-coded status indicators and clear success/failure metrics
- **Interactive Elements**: Copy-to-clipboard functionality for genesis commitments, transaction IDs, and note IDs
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing

## Account Management

When the network transaction service is enabled, the monitor manages the necessary Miden accounts:

### Created Accounts

**Network Account:**
- Implements a simple counter with increment functionality
- Includes authentication logic that restricts access to the network account
- Uses custom MASM script with account ID-based authorization
- Automatically created if not present

**Wallet Account:**
- Uses RpoFalcon512 authentication scheme
- Contains authentication keys for transaction signing
- Automatically created if not present

### Account File Management

The monitor automatically:
1. Checks for existing account files on startup
2. Creates new accounts if files don't exist
3. Deploys accounts to the network via RPC
4. Saves the wallet and counter contract account in the specified file paths (default: `wallet_account.mac` and `counter_program.mac`)

### Example Usage

```bash
# Start monitor with counter task and default account files
miden-network-monitor start --rpc-url https://testnet.miden.io:443

# Start monitor with custom account file paths
miden-network-monitor start \
  --disable-ntx-service=false \
  --rpc-url https://testnet.miden.io:443 \
  --wallet-filepath my_wallet.mac \
  --counter-filepath my_counter.mac

# The generated files can be loaded in Miden applications:
# - wallet_account.mac: Contains the wallet account with authentication keys
# - counter_program.mac: Contains the counter program account
```

## Future Monitor Items

- Match explorer's block height with node's chain tip.
- Add more transaction types to the test suite (P2ID, Swap, etc.).
